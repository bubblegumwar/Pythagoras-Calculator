# Pythagoras-Calculator
A simple function written in python to calculate the length of a side in a right angle triangle. 


## **USAGE**:
The fuction will return the lenght of an unkown side of a triangle

Call the function by using pythagoras()

The function needs 3 arguments

### **Explanation of Arguments:**


**SIDE** : The side you want to calculate (The unkown) // Lowercase is prefered.
"a" = Calculate side a
"b" = Calculate side b
"c" = Calculate side c (The hypotenues)

**LEN1** : A side you know. The biggest value should go here // the hypotenues.

**LEN2** : A side you know. The smaller value should go here.




## **USAGE EXAMPLE:**

To find the hypotenues of a 3,4,5 triangle:
    
    ```python 
    pythagoras("c",4,3)
    ```

will return the float '5.0'
To find side A of a 3,4,5 triangle:
    'pythagoras("a",5,4)
will return the float '3.0'
To find side B of a 3,4,5 triangle:
    'pythagoras("b",5,3)
will return the float '4.0'
